what are the things we need for the query?
and what is the most economical way to get them?

  * a db name from sx_get_db()
  * a measure name from sx_get_measure()
  * for recodes: an id list and a list of area codes

But what's in an id list?

  * a geo field (description of geo level) obtained with sx_get_geog and stringr
  * a time measure name
  * a list of time periods




And the area codes?
  * they need a geo_id as a prefix
